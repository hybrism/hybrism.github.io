									<div id="list01" class="list"><ul><li><p>My name is Tove. I was born in 1990 on the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden. I have three sisters and one brother and I can say with confidence that I&#39;m the biggest nerd of the bunch.</p></li><li><p>I was not only a regular nerd, I was also a huge horse nerd. One of the first games I remember playing as a kid was a horse customization game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1SZ_5e0I5s&t=576">Paint n Play Pony</a>, a perfectly wonderful product of its time. Customization has since then been a big thing in my life. Almost any game that includes any kind of customization automatically receives a stamp of approval from me.</p></li><li><p>Related to the point above, as a pre-teen my dream was to become a character designer. I was always drawing new characters with cool outfits and weapons and coming up with background stories for them, highly influenced by the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. I don&#39;t draw anymore, but I still come up with little background stories for a lot of characters that don&#39;t already have one.</p></li><li><p>As my fixation grew I started making my own dress up games in MS Paint using a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisekae_Set_System">Kisekae Set System</a>. I haven&#39;t revisited this program since and unfortunately the art I created has been lost in time, but I&#39;ve since realized that this was actually the start of my programming journey.</p></li><li><p>I started working in a clothing store when I was 18, not really pursuing the character designer dream but kind of in the same fashion <span style="color: gray">(pun intended?)</span>. There I went from working on the shop floor, to department manager, then floor manager and lastly promoted to store controller (which is basically assistant store manager). With a strong dislike of repeating the same unnecessarily complicated tasks, it was during this time I discovered my penchant for optimizing the store&#39;s various work routines.</p></li><li><p>I was also the one in charge of handling the store&#39;s stock routines, and some time around 2019 I was chosen to become a pilot tester for a new stock management system. Working in close contact with the assigned IT department made me realize that this was actually something one could work with, specializing in creating systems for more efficient workflows. Ultimately, this realization along with some other things, led me to go looking for a new career.</p></li><li><p>In 2022, I sent my application to <a href="https://thegameassembly.com/">The Game Assembly</a>, got accepted into the school and 2½ years later and here I am! A fully educated Game Programmer, just starting my journey into the games industry.</p></li></ul></div>
